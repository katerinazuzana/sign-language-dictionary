# Czech Sign Language Dictionary
> A bilingual dictionary for translating expressions to and from czech and czech sign language.

The Dictionary is built in Python 3 using the tkinter library and SQLite database.

Note: As I don't have permission to share publically the videos with sign language translations, the videos in the application don't capture actual signing persons, but there are demo animations (with a piece of text running across the screen) instead.
